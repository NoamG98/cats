                    cutest pets in the world. Whether they're curled up for a nap or chasing after
                    a toy, cats never fail to bring joy to their owners' lives.

                    <h3>Fact 1: Cats Have Whiskers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cats have specialized hairs on their faces called whiskers. These whiskers
                        are highly sensitive and help cats navigate their surroundings.

                    <p>
                        On average, cats sleep for about 15 hours a day. They love finding cozy spots
                        to curl up and take a snooze.

                    <h3>Fact 3: Cats Are Agile Jumpers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cats are known for their incredible jumping abilities. They can leap up to
                        six times their body length in a single bound!

                    <h3>Fact 4: Cats Communicate with Tail</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cats use their tails to communicate their mood and intentions. A flicking tail
                        may indicate excitement, while a tucked tail suggests fear or submission.

                    <h3>Fact 5: Cats Have Night Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cats have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in low light conditions.
                        This adaptation helps them hunt effectively, even in the dark.
